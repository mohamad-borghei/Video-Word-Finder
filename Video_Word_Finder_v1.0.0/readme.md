# Video Word Finder

Sometimes, you need to search for a specific word in a movie. 
Doing this manually can be time-consuming. With this project, 
you can quickly find out exactly when the word youâ€™re looking 
for appears by simply entering it into the program.

## Features: 
1. Recognizing the desired word and when that word was said in the movie
2. Recognize all the sentences spoken in the video
3. Recognizing all the words and when they were said in the movie
3. Find words similar to the keyword from most similar to least similar in order, 
   and when these words were said in the movie


## Installation and commissioning
### **First, we install the prerequisites:**
pip install tk==0.1.0

pip install moviepy==1.0.3

pip install pydub==0.25.1

pip install pandas==2.2.2

pip install SpeechRecognition==3.11.0

pip install openpyxl==3.1.5

#### Note:
**Please ensure that FFMPEG is installed before using the pydub library.
You can refer to the link below for assistance with the installation:**

### **How to run the program :** 
1. You open the [main_tk](main_tk.py) file
   And you run it in Python IDE 
2. In part Video File Path, enter the path of the input video in MP4 format.
3. In the "Output Folder Path" section, specify the directory where you'd like to save the output files.
4. In the "Keyword" field, enter the word you want to search for in the movie.
5. The program splits the movie into smaller segments for processing. In the "Chunk Duration (seconds)" field, specify the duration (in seconds) for each segment.
   A default value of 30 seconds is recommended.
6. Click the Start Processing button to start

#### Note:
**You may enter the keyword and chunk duration into a model that may change after preprocessing. To ensure clarity about the final chunk value and the keyword submitted for final processing, the program will display their final values at the bottom of the opened window.**
